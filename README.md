This is the official repository of "Detection of high-voltage structures as a potential source of false alarms in early fire recognition". In this repository, you can find all the annotations discussed in the article, in addition to the images that have been proposed by the team.
</p>

<p align="justify"> 
It should be noted that the FLIR, $M{^3}FD$, and PID images are open access and can be downloaded from the links provided in the paper. The annotations made respect the original name of these images, only an identifier has been added to each after the original name.
